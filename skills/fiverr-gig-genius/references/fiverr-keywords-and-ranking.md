# Fiverr keywords & ranking (official-community distilled)

Source notes distilled from Fiverr Community posts (2025):
- "Let's talk keywords" (2025-10-09)
- "Understanding the Fiverr algorithm" (2025-06-02)

## How search works (high level)
- Fiverr scans **Gig titles first**, then uses **tags** to add context.
- Search results are **personalized** per buyer (your own search view is not authoritative).

## Keyword research (without Seller Plus)
- Use Fiverr search bar autocomplete suggestions while typing your service.
- Click into your subcategory and inspect **successful listings**:
  - what they promise (outcome)
  - which buyer type they target
  - phrasing patterns in titles

## Use keywords effectively
- Put the **strongest keyword** (what buyers actually type) into the **title**.
- Keep title readable; avoid keyword stuffing.
- Use **tags** to complement the title (add coverage for adjacent phrases).
- Prefer **not** duplicating the exact title keyword in multiple tags if it costs you breadth.

Example from Fiverr Community:
- Title: “I will set up Facebook and Instagram ads campaign for your business”
- Tags: facebook marketing, facebook ads, fb ads campaign, meta ads manager, meta ads

## Updating keywords (don’t thrash)
- Keywords are not set-and-forget: review roughly **monthly**.
- If you change SEO/title/tags, give changes **3–4 weeks** before judging (don’t over-optimize).

## Ranking factors (non-SEO)
- Buyer satisfaction heavily influences ranking; prioritize delivery quality + reviews.
- Consistent activity helps: long inactivity may reduce visibility.
- Daily analytics dips are normal; focus on longer trends.
