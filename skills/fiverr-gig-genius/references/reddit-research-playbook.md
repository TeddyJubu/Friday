# Reddit research playbook (for Fiverr gig positioning)

Goal: extract real buyer language, pain points, and objections to feed into gig copy.

## Where to look
- Subreddits where your buyers hang out (examples: r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, r/startups, r/ecommerce, niche subs)
- Also look for freelancer/buyer complaints (examples: r/freelance, r/webdev, r/marketing)

## What to search for
Use keyword patterns:
- "looking for" + service
- "recommend" + service
- "need help" + outcome
- "how much should I pay" + service
- "hired a freelancer" + service
- "bad experience" + service

## What to extract (copy/paste into notes)
- Exact phrases buyers use to describe the problem
- Desired outcomes (what "success" looks like)
- Constraints (budget, timeline, tools)
- Objections and fears
- What they hated about previous providers

## Turn findings into gig copy
- Hook line: mirror the most common pain phrase.
- Bullets: map each pain → deliverable.
- FAQ: turn objections into questions.
- Requirements: reflect constraints (access, brand assets, data).

## Guardrails
- Don’t quote usernames.
- Don’t claim to be endorsed by Reddit.
- Use patterns, not personal data.
