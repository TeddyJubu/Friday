# Gig Blueprint Templates

Use these as copy/paste skeletons. Keep claims honest and specific.

## 0) Intake (what to ask the seller)
- Service: what exactly do you do (deliverables + tools)?
- Target buyer: industry, company size, role.
- Proof: portfolio links, before/after, case studies, certifications.
- Constraints: turnaround, revisions, availability, timezone.
- Differentiators: what you do differently (process, speed, niche expertise).

## 1) Offer statement (one sentence)
"I help [buyer type] achieve [outcome] by delivering [deliverable] using [method/tools], with [proof/constraint]."

Examples:
- "I help busy founders ship a conversion-focused landing page by delivering a Figma + Webflow build in 72 hours, backed by 20+ launches." 

## 2) Gig title formula
Aim: buyer intent keyword + outcome + specificity.

Pattern:
"I will [primary service keyword] for [buyer/industry] to [outcome]"

Notes:
- Keep natural language.
- Ensure the first words contain the primary keyword.

## 3) Tags (5)
- 2–3 exact intent phrases buyers type
- 1–2 adjacent/related phrases
- 0–1 tool/platform term

Avoid wasting tags repeating the exact title phrasing if it reduces coverage.

## 4) Description skeleton
### Hook (2–3 lines)
- Mirror buyer pain + desired outcome.

### What you get (bullets)
- Deliverable 1 (specific)
- Deliverable 2
- Deliverable 3

### How it works (3–5 steps)
1. You answer a short questionnaire.
2. I review your inputs and confirm scope.
3. I deliver first draft.
4. Revisions (as per package).
5. Final delivery + handoff notes.

### Why me (3–5 bullets)
- Proof (results, years, niche)
- Process (quality controls)
- Communication (response time window)

### Requirements (what you need from buyer)
- Access/credentials (if needed)
- Brand assets
- Examples/competitors

### CTA
"Message me before ordering if you’re unsure which package fits—I'll recommend the best option."

## 5) Packages (Basic/Standard/Premium)
Use outcome-based packaging. Each higher tier adds *scope* OR *speed* OR *risk reduction*.

Template:
- Basic: "Starter" — one core deliverable, limited revisions.
- Standard: "Pro" — adds a second deliverable or deeper scope.
- Premium: "Complete" — adds strategy + extras + priority delivery.

Rules of thumb:
- Make the Standard your best value.
- Avoid vague “unlimited” unless you truly mean it.

## 6) FAQ patterns (write 5–8)
- "What do you need from me to start?"
- "How many revisions are included?"
- "Can you match my brand style?"
- "Do you offer faster delivery?"
- "What if I don’t like the first draft?"
- "Do you provide source files?"

## 7) Buyer requirements questionnaire (copy/paste)
1. Your goal for this project (1–2 sentences):
2. Target audience:
3. Links/assets (Google Drive/Dropbox):
4. Examples you like:
5. Must-have features/constraints:
6. Deadline:

## 8) Gig gallery guidance
- 1 hero image: outcome + niche + offer (big text, simple).
- 1 process graphic: 3–5 steps.
- 1 proof image: before/after or metrics (blur sensitive data).
- 1 package comparison chart.

Keep text readable on mobile.
