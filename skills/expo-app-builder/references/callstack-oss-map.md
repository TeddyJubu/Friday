# Callstack OSS Map (Expo/RN)

Use this map when selecting ecosystem tooling.

- React Native Paper: component library/design system for RN apps.
- Re.Pack: advanced bundling and module federation for RN; adopt only if Metro constraints are proven.
- React Native Builder Bob: scaffolding/building React Native libraries.
- React Native Testing Library: behavior-focused RN testing.

Selection rule: choose the smallest tool that solves the current constraint with stable maintenance and docs.
